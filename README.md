# CryptArch
Final project for Computer Architecture class Fall 2015 about cryptography.
We implemented AES encryption and decryption in Verilog. Our python files walk the user through the process and do the plaintext to ascii hex conversions.

For instructions on how to use: please see user_encryption.py
